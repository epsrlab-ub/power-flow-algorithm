# Power Flow Algorithm Repository

This repository contains a collection of **MATLAB** and **Python** codes that solve **AC power flow problems** using five conventional methods.  
The algorithms have been validated on the **33-bus distribution test system** for usersâ€™ convenience, and they are capable of being applied to various types of system networks, including radial and mesh configurations.

## Contents
- **Backward/Forward Sweep Method**
- **Newtonâ€“Raphson Power Method**
- **Newtonâ€“Raphson Current Method**
- **Z-Bus Method**
- **Decoupled Power Flow Method**

**Note:**  
The algorithms provided in this repository are designed and validated for **single-phase** power flow analysis.  
They do not currently support three-phase or unbalanced system modeling.  
Modifications are required to extend the algorithms for multi-phase applications.
